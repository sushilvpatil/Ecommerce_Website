**E-Shop (React eCommerce Website)**

**_Introduction_**

E-Shop is a React-based eCommerce website that I created to enhance my understanding of React concepts, frontend development, Redux, and state management. This project includes user authentication, product filtering, a wishlist, a shopping cart, and a responsive UI.

Product Listing: Displays products dynamically fetched from an API.

Category-Based Filtering: Users can filter products by categories like Men, Women, and Kids.

Wishlist Functionality: Users can add/remove products from their wishlist.

Shopping Cart: Implemented with Redux to dynamically update quantity and total price.

Search Functionality: Users can search for products using a search bar.

Lazy Loading: Products are loaded with a 2-second delay for a smooth user experience.

Navigation Bar: Dynamically updates based on user authentication status.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for different screen sizes.

Technologies Used

State Management: Redux

Routing: React Router
